			<div>A long time ago, when the Earth was green</div>
			<div>There was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen</div>
			<div>They'd run around free while the Earth was being born</div>
			<div>But the loveliest of them all was the unicorn</div>
		</p>

		<div class="chorus">
			<p>
				<div>There was green alligators and long-necked geese</div>
				<div>Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees</div>
				<div>Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born</div>
			</p>

			<div>But God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain</div>
			<div>And He says, "Stand back, I'm going to make it rain"</div>
			<div>He says, Hey Brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do</div>
			<div>Build me a floating zoo,</div>
			<div>and take some of them...</div>
		</p>

		<div class="chorus">
			<p>
				<div>Green alligators and long-necked geese</div>
				<div>Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees</div>
				<div>Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born</div>

			<div>Old Noah was there to answer the call</div>
			<div>He finished up making the ark just as the rain started falling</div>
			<div>He marched in the animals in two by two</div>
			<div>And he called out as they went through</div>
			<div>Hey Lord,</div>
		</p>

		<div class="chorus">
			<p>
				<div>I've got green alligators and long-necked geese</div>
				<div>Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees</div>
				<div>Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord, I'm so forlorn</div>
			</p>

			<div>And Noah looked out through the driving rain</div>
			<div>Them unicorns were hiding, playing silly games</div>
			<div>Kicking and splashing while the rain was falling</div>
			<div>Oh, them silly unicorns</div>
		</p>

		<div class="chorus">
			<p>
				<div>There was green alligators and long-necked geese</div>
				<div>Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees</div>
				<div>Noah cried, Close the door because the rain is falling</div>
			</p>
		</div>
			
		<div class="refrain">And we just can't wait for no unicorns</div>

		<p class="verse-number">[verse 5]</p>	
		<p>
			<div>The ark started moving, it drifted with the tide</div>
			<div>The unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried</div>
			<div>And the waters came down and sort of floated them away</div>
			<div>And that's why you never seen a unicorn to this very day</div>
		</p>

		<div class="chorus">
			<p>
				<div>You'll see green alligators and long-necked geese</div>
				<div>Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees</div>
				<div>Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born</div>
			</p>
