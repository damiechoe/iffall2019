				 <strong>Majors:</strong> International & Area Studies, Communication Design <br>
					<strong>Year:</strong> Senior</li><br>

			<li>Considering how user interfaces have become such an integral part of society, I think an understanding of how webpages are built and designed would be very useful to know in any number of industries or disciplines.</li><br> 

			<li>I took CSE131 a couple years ago where I learned the basics of Java, but unfortunately I think I have since forgotten most of the course content.</li><br>

			<li>I hope to understand how the design process changes when creating something in a digital format. </li><br>

			<li>I imagine that designing for the screen needs to be a lot more thoughtful. Because it takes so much effort and time to code, check for errors, and <i>then</i> evaluate the outcome, the decision-making process will likely have to be more thoughtful than just moving shapes around on inDesign.</li><br>

			<li>I think that <a href="https://www.imgur.com" title="effective design" target="_blank"> Imgur</a> is representative of good design. An online image-sharing platform, the user interface is simple to use but detailed enough where users can legibly browse through thousands of images while still having access to relevant information on upvotes, comments and views.  </li><br>

			<li>In my opinion, the WashU <a href="https://artsci.wustl.edu/ampersand" title="effective communication" target="_blank"> Ampersand</a> demonstrates effective communication. A site devoted to sharing all of the latest news and developments in the college of arts and sciences, its design renders the hierarchy of information on the page very clear. The most newsworthy information appears at the top in a very visually dominant way with other stories appearing below in the order they were published. </li><br>

			<li><a href="https://google.com" title="works well" target="_blank"> Google</a> has always worked well for me. I think the site "works well" due to its efficiency and utility. Although the famous search engine is among the more visually unremarkable websites I've visited, it reliably and quickly provides a relevant results page for every impulsive or pressing question I've ever asked it. </li>
