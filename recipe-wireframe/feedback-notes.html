<h3>I got feedback from David Bromberg and Professor Abram Siemsen.</h3>

<ul><h4>David's Feedback</h4></ul>
<ul>-He recommends putting the number in-line with the rest of the copy for legibility and a cleaner appearance.</ul>
<ul>-I should also align the recipe copy to line up with the center of the images on the left.</ul>
<ul>-There were also some concerns about the legibility of the type. He advised making the font a little larger.</ul>

<ul><h4>Professor Abram's Feedback</h4></ul>
<ul><h5>Technical Advice:</h5></ul>
<ul>-When building my website, I should create layered boxes with colored backgrounds instead of trying to make one large colored box that spans the height of my site.</ul>
<ul>-I should consider the alignment of my copy, whether it should be aligned with the top of the image or aligned with the image center.</ul>
<ul>-If the height of my recipe text ever exceeds the height of the image, I can use the 'flex-box' capabilites in CSS to grow the height of the container to accommodate the extra copy.</ul>
<ul>-When making my two-column ingredients section, I should consider using the 'col-count' function, which would be appropriate in this contained, 2-column example.</ul>
<ul><h5>Design Advice:</h5></ul>
<ul>-The font-size should be larger with greater leading in order to increase legibility.</ul>
<ul>-I should play around with the title treatment because it's not immediately apparent that 'Bibimbap' is the recipe name. Perhaps this can be done by using a different font family.</ul>
<ul>-I might consider making the colored background a lighter hue in order to make the relationship between image and text a little more obvious.</ul>
