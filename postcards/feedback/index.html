	<h1>Feedback for Zoe Newton from Damie</h1>

	<div>For convenience, I labelled the postcards A, B, and C based on the order they appear on the site.</div>
	<div>A (I’m not bossy...)</div>
	<div>B (Your self worth...)</div>
	<div>C (I slay...)</div>

	<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
	
	<div class="feedback">
		<h3>Postcard A</h3>
			<li>-There’s a nice stark, black background on this image — good choice! I wouldn’t worry about treating the picture to accommodate the text. </li>
			<li>-But it’s not super clear what the white structures behind her are. I would consider maybe photoshopping these out for a cleaner appearance.</li>
			<li>-As far as typographic treatment goes, I like how you picked a bold sans serif to represent these quotes; it works well thematically. I would recommend decreasing the kerning between the letters, or maybe use it strategically to emphasize a specific word, similarly to how you used the hot pink color on the word “boss”.</li>
			<li>-I think Beyoncé has an accented ‘e’ at the end of her name.</li>
			<li>-I notice that the color is gone at the mobile size, and the white font is unclear on top of her sparkly outfit. I would recommend keeping the pink color combination — it might preserve text legibility.</li>

		<h3>Postcard B</h3>
			<li>-For this image, I think that the background image has a pink-ish hue that slightly compromises type visibility. This could be easily fixed by applying a filter to the image that tones down the amount of pink. Alternatively, you could use photoshop to blur out some of the images in the background.</li>
			<li>-I think this quote is missing punctuation at the mobile size, and at the desktop size there’s a tiny “lorem ipsum” on top of the ‘O’ of ‘YOU’. </li>

		<h3>Postcard C</h3>
			<li>-This image is particularly striking because of the hot pink over the black and white image. I think the typographic treatment is especially effective for this image. </li>
	</div>


	<h2>Structure</h2>

	<div class="feedback">
		<h3>Postcard A</h3>
			<li>-My attention is pretty evenly balanced between the image and the text. The sparkly image of Beyoncé competes pretty evenly for attention with the bold typeface you chose, and I think this is effective for this image because of the monochromatic black background.</li>
			<li>-Looking at the mobile version, “-Beyonce” was removed to accommodate the text and image. To better accommodate for variable screen size, I would consider maybe making the font a little smaller so that you don’t have to worry about fitting in both image and text at smaller screen sizes. </li>

		<h3>Postcard B</h3>
			<li>-At the mobile version for this postcard, the visibility of the white text is also compromised by her sparkly outfit. One technique you could try is applying an overlay over the entire image to make it darker so you could keep the placement but increase visibility.</li>
			<li>-You picked some really pretty pictures. I think there’s room to play with scale and placement. For example, for the smaller screens, you could make a new image that pushes down the image of Beyoncé so you could showcase her elaborate headdress while increasing the amount of empty space, which would also create space for the quote. </li>
			
		<h3>Postcard C</h3>
			<li>-At the larger sizes, I would maybe consider blurring out the marbling behind the type just to be super sure that the type isn’t compromised.</li>
			<li>-But the placement of the type is especially effective for this image because of the black, empty space provided by her hat at the smaller sizes. I would just be mindful of how that type travels from the far left to her hat as the screen gets smaller.</li>
			<li>-I think that the leading could be decreased between the type, especially on the mobile screen.</li>
	</div>

	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>

	<div class="feedback">
		<h3>Postcard A</h3>
			<li>-I observe that the load time for the site takes a while. I would explore why that might be.</li>
			<li>-The resolution of all three images are slightly blurry. I would look for the images at a slightly higher resolution, or maybe apply a ‘softening’ filter on top of the images to mask the blurriness.</li>
			<li>-Text legibility is a bit compromised, so other recommendations to fix this would be to use a colored block behind the text, or maybe even a “floor fade” to increase legibility.</li>
			<li>-I notice that the text aligns to the left frame in the mobile version. I would be thoughtful about when this transition occurs. By just shifting the scale of the image, you could maybe even keep the type where it was, but just decrease font size. </li>
